As a Cloud Security Auditor within a fintech organization,
I want to systematically identify, analyze, and document network-level vulnerabilities across the AWS 3-tier architecture (Public/Web, Application, and Data tiers), including VPC design, subnet segregation, routing, internet gateways, NAT gateways, load balancers, security groups, EC2 instances, RDS connectivity, and network logging,
so that misconfigurations, excessive trust relationships, and unintended internet exposure are clearly identified,
and realistic attack paths such as external compromise, lateral movement between tiers, and unauthorized access to regulated financial data can be demonstrated,
allowing the organization to prioritize remediation based on risk, reduce the attack surface, and meet regulatory and audit expectations under PCI DSS, RBI cybersecurity guidelines, and ISO 27001.
