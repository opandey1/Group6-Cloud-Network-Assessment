User Story-2  the Security threats of Cloud network using AI tools


Purpose: 
Analysis to include Threats in general and particular to Single Cloud Network

Acceptance Criteria:
1.	The solution to have clarity on the threats in general available, methods of analysis of threats.
2.	Provide analysis on the Single Cloud network in general and not particular.
3.	The answers received from different tools should be consistent to be included in final report.
4.	The solution should not be overdone/ lengthy.

Learnings:
Sometimes the different AI tools use different nomenclatures and attention to description clarifies that they are mentioning same thing.
Using deep thinking/ detailed options in AI tools may result in lengthy report/solution which may be overdoing for the purpose (for e.g. resulting in a literature of 50-70 pages etc.)  or alternatively making the report brief prompt (reduce it to 50% for e.g.) may result in too brief description retaining only headlines or one or two im-portant lines.
