User Story-1 Using AI tools for research


Purpose: 
As a new student of AI tools, I need to know how the prompts to be used.

Acceptance Criteria:
1.	The prompt results in answers in easily understandable language.
2.	Provide references from which the answers are derived.
3.	The answers received cover the specific area of interest.

Learnings:
The links provided for references need to be verified as some of the answers were given based on a document already generated and available on laptop- The prompt should include the statement  to the effect that refer-ences should be from web (not from local resource/computer)
