Act as a senior cloud security auditor. Define the scope of a network security vulnerability assessment for an AWS 3-tier VPC architecture used by a fintech company. Cover VPC, subnets, IGW, NAT Gateway, ALB, Security Groups, EC2, RDS, and network logging.

Identify common network vulnerabilities in an AWS 3-tier architecture (Public, Application, Data subnets). Present findings with vulnerability name, risk level, and business impact in a fintech context.

Analyze risks caused by weak subnet tier isolation in an AWS 3-tier VPC. Focus on lateral movement paths from public web tier to data tier.

List security risks arising from over-permissive AWS Security Group rules in a 3-tier architecture. Focus on inbound, outbound, and tier-to-tier trust issues.

Assess internet exposure risks in an AWS 3-tier design involving ALB, Internet Gateway, and EC2 instances. Highlight attack surface expansion and exploitation risks.

Evaluate security risks related to unrestricted outbound access via NAT Gateway in an AWS 3-tier fintech environment. Focus on data exfiltration and C2 risks.

Identify network-level vulnerabilities affecting RDS in a 3-tier AWS architecture, including subnet isolation, security groups, and replication traffic exposure.

Map AWS 3-tier network security weaknesses to fintech compliance requirements (PCI DSS, RBI, ISO 27001). Present risks and their compliance impact.

Describe a realistic attacker lateral movement path in an AWS 3-tier architecture, from ALB-exposed web tier to RDS data tier, step by step.

Identify key AWS network monitoring gaps (VPC Flow Logs, ALB logs, NAT, RDS logs) in a 3-tier architecture and recommend high-level mitigations.
